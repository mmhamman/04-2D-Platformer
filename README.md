# Project Name
2D Platformer

A 2D game where you avoid mines, bats and collect coins

## Implementation
Save and Load
Enemies (bats and mines)
Coins
Tileset with texture and colliders

## References

## Future Development
none

## Note
Although the game is lacking raw additional features it took quite a deal of effort to figure out what was wrong with the bat script that made it crash upon colliding with the player, which is what took up most of the time.
